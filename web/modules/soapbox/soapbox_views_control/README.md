# How to use

When adding the Views Reference field, the new options
will be available:

1. Filters to show
1. Content types to limit to

The filters to show allows the site editor to disable
exposed filters when adding the View to the page. Your
View must have Exposed Filters available.

The content types to limit to further restricts a
content type filter. Your View must have a
filter on 'Content Type' available.
